						<p>Plug-in-Play represents a playground of ideas related to how we engage our urban environments. By taking a number of objects (some existing and some staged) in San Jose City Hall Plaza and connecting these objects to the building facade via oversized theatrical plugs, we suggest a new type of environment wherein social interactions, citizenship, and personal activities are more dynamically reflected. Through the application of a projected environment on the facade of City Hall, the LAB at Rockwell Group is able to display both physical and virtual activity in the plaza. The  resulting effect constitutes an attempt to create a more accurate representation of the vitality and complexity of our urban environments.</p>
<p>The conceptual origins for Plug-in-Play cover a broad span of architectural and technical innovation. The title of the piece is itself a direct reference to Peter Cook’s Plug-in-City (1964), a theoretical and all-encompassing urban framework that emphasized flexibility and impermanence through the application of a computer-directed “feedback loop.” Today, Cook’s emphasis on cybernetic exchange in cyberspace as a method of “plugging in” to the physical world is reflected in computer encoding concepts such as the “Internet of Things,” wherein the networked connection of everyday objects allows urban inhabitants to connect to or even correct their physical surroundings. Plug-in-Play seeks to demonstrate the interconnectedness of the people and things through play, social media, and human interaction.</p>
